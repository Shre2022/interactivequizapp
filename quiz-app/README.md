The main goal of creating this quiz app is to create a dynamic and interactive quiz. 

This browser app will present a series of questions for the user, where they will receive immediate feedback on their answers whether the answer is Correct or Wrong. To do this, I have used JavaScript DOM (Document Object Model). I have also used Bootstrap in this project to enhance the UI. 

Here's a list of programming languages I have used to create the quiz app:

HTML5: USed to Structuring the quiz page content with semantic HTML5.
JavaScript: Used JS to manage the quiz logic, event handling, and DOM manipulation.
Bootstrap: Used Bootstrap components for an enhanced UI with modals and buttons.
CSS: used for Styling the quiz interface and layout while including a responsive design.

This is a simple web application but quite useful when it comes to learn more of how DOM manipulation and event handlers work!
